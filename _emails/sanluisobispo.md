subject: Budget for the Well-Being of San Luis Obispo
body: |-
    Dear San Luis Obispo City Council,

    My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of San Luis Obispo. I am writing to demand that the San Luis Obispo City Council adopt a city budget that prioritizes community well-being, and redirects funding away from the police.

    In 2019, the City of San Luis Obispo allocated 36.3 million dollars to our police system, an inordinate 27.5% of our total budget. This is compared to just $9.7 million allocated towards community development (7.3% of the budget). with only $1.4 million towards housing development.

    I demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the San Luis Obispo Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of San Luis Obispo residents.

    History has shown that police "reform" is not enough. We must take a hard look at the way the current system in place fails to serve-and in fact actively harms-our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.

    I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care not cops.

    Thank you for your time,
