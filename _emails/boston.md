  Hello, 

  My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am a resident of Boston in [YOUR COUNTY] County and I am emailing today to express my unequivocal support for the resolution introduced by Congresswoman Pressley and other leaders of color on Tuesday. I would like to know what the Mayor's plan is to support the issues encompassed in this resolution at the local level. I am also demanding that Mayor Walsh take specific measures to decrease police violence. 

  I demand that the Mayor support the desires of our Boston community and hear our call for: 
  * Efforts to improve oversight and independent investigations to hold individual law enforcement officers and police departments accountable
  * Supporting efforts to establish an all civilian review board with the authority to investigate incidents of police misconduct, to ensure community level oversight accountability and discipline the reaction of police officers
  * The adoption of sound and unbiased law enforcement policies at all levels of government that reduce the disparate impact of police brutality racial profiling and use of force on black and brown people, and other historically marginalized communities.
  * Action to address the racial wealth gap in Boston and decrease the spread of rampant gentrification and rising housing costs that disproportionately target black and brown residents. 

  Mayor Walsh can take specific action RIGHT NOW by enacting the following policies: 
  * Requiring officers to de-escalate situations before using force, mandating de-escalation training for officers, and requiring that police forces de-escalate as soon as resistance decreases 
  * Require that officers always give a clear verbal warning before discharging firearms
  * Require that officers intervene if another officer is threatening excessive force or using excessive force, and train all officers to do so
  Require that all officers submit a report after any threat to use a firearm or any use of a firearm
  * I would like to hear the Mayor's position on this resolution loud and clear, and see a clear plan forward on all of the above actions. 

  Sincerely, 
  [YOUR NAME]
