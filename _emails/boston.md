subject: Demanding support for unbiased law enforcement policies
body: "Hello, \n\nMy name is [YOUR NAME]. I am a resident of Boston in [YOUR COUNTY]
  County and I am emailing today to express my unequivocal support for the resolution
  introduced by Congresswoman Pressley and other leaders of color on Tuesday. I would
  like to know what the Mayor's plan is to support the issues encompassed in this
  resolution at the local level. I am also demanding that Mayor Walsh take specific
  measures to decrease police violence. \n\nI demand that the Mayor support the desires
  of our Boston community and hear our call for: \n* Efforts to improve oversight
  and independent investigations to hold individual law enforcement officers and police
  departments accountable\n* Supporting efforts to establish an all civilian review
  board with the authority to investigate incidents of police misconduct, to ensure
  community level oversight accountability and discipline the reaction of police officers\n*
  The adoption of sound and unbiased law enforcement policies at all levels of government
  that reduce the disparate impact of police brutality racial profiling and use of
  force on black and brown people, and other historically marginalized communities.\n*
  Action to address the racial wealth gap in Boston and decrease the spread of rampant
  gentrification and rising housing costs that disproportionately target black and
  brown residents. \n\nMayor Walsh can take specific action RIGHT NOW by enacting
  the following policies: \n* Requiring officers to de-escalate situations before
  using force, mandating de-escalation training for officers, and requiring that police
  forces de-escalate as soon as resistance decreases \n* Require that officers always
  give a clear verbal warning before discharging firearms\n* Require that officers
  intervene if another officer is threatening excessive force or using excessive force,
  and train all officers to do so\nRequire that all officers submit a report after
  any threat to use a firearm or any use of a firearm\n* I would like to hear the
  Mayor's position on this resolution loud and clear, and see a clear plan forward
  on all of the above actions. \n\nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR
  EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n"
