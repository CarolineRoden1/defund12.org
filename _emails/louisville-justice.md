subject: I Want Justice  for the Murder of Breonna Taylor
body: |
  Dear Mayor Fischer,
  
  My name is [NAME]. I am a resident of [CITY/NEIGHBORHOOD] and I am emailing today to demand accountability for the racist and brutal murder of Breonna Taylor.
  
  I demand that charges be pressed against all officers involved in this heinous crime and its coverup, especially John Mattingly, Brett Hankinson, and Myles Cosgrove. There have been no charges thus far and this is unacceptable.
  
  Breonna Taylor would be alive today if it was not for the gross abuse of power and negligence exhibited by the Louisville Metro Police Department; all officers involved must face consequences for this murder in order to provide her family with justice and prevent further cops from committing brutal acts of violence against our communities.
  
  WE DEMAND THE FOLLOWING OF OUR CITY:
  
  1. Mayor and City Council address the use of force by LMPD.
  
  2. Fire and revoke the pensions of the officers that murdered Breonna. Arrest, charge, and convict them for this crime. Ensure the newly requested special prosecutor, State AG Daniel Cameron, seeks full transparency and accountability.
  
  3. Provide all necessary information to a local, independent civilian community police accountability council #CPAC.
  
  4. Create policy for transparent investigation process due to law enforcement misconduct. 
  
  5. Eliminate No Knock Warrants.
  
  Sincerely,
  [NAME]
