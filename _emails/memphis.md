  Hello,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am asking to redirect money away from the Memphis PD and into the following social services: 
  * Community Development
  * COVID Relief
  * Education, Parks & Recreation
  
  I request that an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny the mayorâ€™s proposed budget and reallocate these funds to resources the citizens can benefit from.

  Thank you for your time,

  [YOUR NAME]
