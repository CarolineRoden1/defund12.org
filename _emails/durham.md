subject: Defund the Durham Police & Reallocate Funds
body: "Dear Mayor Schewel & City Council Members:\n\nMy name is \\[YOUR NAME\\]. I
  am a resident of Durham. I am writing to object to the allocation of over $70M to
  the Durham Police Department in the 2020-2021 city budget. It is indefensible to
  increase the police budget when city workers face layoffs and denial of wage increases,
  and thousands of our community members face unemployment, and housing and food insecurity
  in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe police cannot protect us from these
  challenges. In fact, more often than not, when police are dispensed, rather than
  more qualified medical, psychiatric, and social work professionals, the effect is
  to bring violence where none previously existed, despite the best efforts of all
  involved. Moreover, to paraphrase an existing council member, it is not cities with
  the most police, but the most resources, that are the safest.  To that end, I make
  a two-fold request to the council:\n\nReallocate all proposed increases in police
  budget to Durham Public Schools, affordable housing and rent subsidies, eviction
  diversions, food resources, and medical supplies, which have both immediate and
  longstanding consequences that will more positively affect our current residents.\nImplement
  a 5-year plan to reallocate---at a minimumâ€”50% of existing police resources to institutions
  and experts better equipped to deal with many of the issues DPD have been conscripted,
  without adequate training, to do. Resources should be allocated to EMTs, social
  workers, and other social service providers to respond to the majority of current
  police business, including health and wellness checks, domestic/sexual violence
  situations, and basic bureaucratic documentation around break-ins, vandalism, wrecks,
  etc. Additional money should go to community education around de-escalation and
  community support for drug, SV/DV, and property-related incidents.  I recommend
  that you follow the lead of progressive cities such as Austin, TX and Camden, NJ
  in this regard. There is no reason to have armed officers responding the majority
  of emergency needs in Durham. \n\nFinally, I request that you divest over half the
  force of offensive weapons. Offensive weapons are known to escalate violence, especially
  when deployed in situations where none existed before. Almost all the current litany
  of Black men and women dead from police violence were non-violent, unarmed people,
  for whom armed police became the site of death and violence. We, as a community,
  need to commit to non-violent policing and pro-people programs.\n\nThank you,\n\\[YOUR
  NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]"
