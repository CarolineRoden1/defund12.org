subject: Defund the CPD
body: |
  Hello, I am [name] and I am a resident of [neighborhood/city].

  The City of Cleveland needs to address a lack of investment in predominantly Black and Brown communities and an over-investment in their criminalization. Although the current fiscal year city budget was approved in March, the City of Cleveland must reduce the Cleveland Police Department budget.

  After a two year investigation ending in 2014, the Justice Department cited CPD for abuse due to a pattern and practice of excessive force. We cannot rely on the Division of Police to “self-evaluate in order to improve in areas of training, efficient and effective delivery of services, officer safety, and community engagement” in the best interest of the public.

  $217,908,375 of the 2020 $1.8 billion budget is allocated to policing. Even though federal mandates from the settlement with the Justice Department require certain budget allocations for consent decree compliance, it is a despicable display of priorities that the 2020 Division of Police budget has increased by $10 million from 2019, an increase that is greater than the entire 2020 Department of Housing budget.

  In his tenure as mayor, Frank Jackson is complicit in the crisis of police brutality. Tragic killings of Black Clevelanders — including Timothy Russell, Malissa Williams, Tamir Rice, Desmond Franklin — have all happened under Mayor Jackson’s tenure. Mayor Jackson said on June 3rd, 2020 in an interview with The Appeal that a) he would not revisit reallocating police at this time b) we cannot rely on the government with regard to ending structural racism and police violence and we should instead look to philanthropy and the private sector. I demand the City of Cleveland reconsider and revisit these stances that are antithetical to social justice and ending police brutality.

  Divest money away from the Division of Police and invest quality of life for all through social services like education, housing, healthcare, cooperative businesses, community centers, and community-led organizations and projects. I know the Cleveland City Council cares about these issues, especially after the recent unanimous vote to declare racism a public health crisis. I ask that you continue to find sustainable, long-term change for the entire community. Research shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at reducing crime than police or prisons.

  Thank you.
