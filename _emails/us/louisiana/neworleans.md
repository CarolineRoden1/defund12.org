  Dear Mayor Cantrell and City Council Members,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a New Orleans resident writing to urge you to defund the New Orleans Police Department.

  The NOPD takes an enormous share of the city’s budget, and that percentage has risen exponentially over the last two decades, taking away desperately needed resources from essential community programs and services. As a member of the community, I am opposed to the high incarceration rates seen in New Orleans. The investment in policing has not made our Black and Brown communities any safer. NOPD remains an embarrassment to this city and a lethal threat to what makes us New Orleans. Meanwhile, police spending has increased. With New Orleans’ budget already under stress, it is clear that we must defund the police.

  As New Orleans residents, we therefore demand that you take immediate action towards the following ends:
  * Reduce NOPD’s allocation from the General Fund by 50% (roughly $100 Million)
  * Discontinue use of General Fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence
  * Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.
  * New Orleans can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to Defund NOPD.

  Thank you for your time,
