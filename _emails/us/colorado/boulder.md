  Dear Council Members of the City of Boulder,

  My name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am writing to urge you to defund the Boulder Police Department.

  I urge you to advocate for a meaningful reallocation of the city's expenditures: away from policing, and towards social programs and resources that support housing, jobs, education, health care, child care, and other critical community needs.

  I also want to surface the harassment of Zayd Atkinson, a resident of Boulder and a student at Naropa University, by the Boulder Police Department. Instead of funding the harassment of Boulder residents of color, the city should fund affordable housing and other community programs.

  The budget for the Boulder Police Department is $37,000,000, while the budget for Housing and Human Services is less than $5,000,000. I strongly suggest that the Boulder Police Department be defunded immediately and that the money go towards creating affordable housing within city limits, along with other community programs that invest in restorative justice, mental health, and our youth.

  Thank you,
